## ‚ô† Creation of this mod
This mod consist of a swf loaded into fallout76 hud menu. Some functionality are limited.

It is not possible to save data. You can look inside this mode swf with Jpexs after extracting them with Archive2.

Editing complex actionscript of Fallout 76 with Jpexs is not recomended.

If so, I suggest you download the project source code for a better read.

Using Jpexs only, first version of this mod was made by editing the svg inside shapes folder.

Svg files are scalable vector graphics insted of rasterized pictures like PNG.

First I was extracting the svg, edit them then replace it with Jpexs.

But, doing so you lose some functionalities like transparency. Might have been corrected with latest release of Jpexs.

For some shapes like squares and rectangles, it doesn't matter transparency.

The best is by using raw edit without replacing svg in shapes folder.

#### FlashDevelop
https://www.flashdevelop.org/

#### JPEXS
https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler

#### Archive2
For Ba2 files. It comes with fallout 4 creation tool.

You can download it in the bethesda launcher.

Default location: Bethesda.net Launcher\games\CK\Tools\Archive2\Archive2.exe


### ‚ô• People to thanks
Big thanks to Keretus and Liyalai for helping improving compatibility with other major HUD interface mods.

They are the one making this mod up to date with Fo76 by decompiling and recompiling the most recent hudmenu.swf 

to include a swf loader for this mod.
You can even do the update for this mod yourself by adding plm hudmenu.swf into this mod Ba2.

That being said, I couldn't have make every options of this mod under one download without Keretus and Liyalai

work.
